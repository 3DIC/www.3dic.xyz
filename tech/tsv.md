# Through-Silicon Vias \(TSVs\)

## Concept of TSVs

`Through-silicon vias (TSVs)` are considered as a key concept in 3D IC. It is necessary \(together with bonding technology\) for vertical interconnections between devices on 3D-stacked IC layers.

On `October 23, 1958`, William Shockley filed a patent “Semiconductive Wafer and Method of Making the Same”, which was granted on July 17, 1962.[^1] Shockley invented a junction semiconductive device with **holes** pass through a wafer from one surface to the other. The wafers and the sidewalls of the holes are doped to be different type \(n or p-type doped\) semiconductor materials, forming a junction between them. As shown in Figure 1, the wafers is p-type doped and then the sidewall \(16\) of the hole is n-type doped.

The purpose of Shockley's patent is to make a lateral junction rather than 3D IC. On `December 28, 1964`, Merlin G Smith, Stern Emanuel at IBM filed a patent “Methods of Making Thru-Connections in Semiconductor Wafers”, which was granted on September 26, 1967[^2] . In this patent, they invented a method forming a **thru-connection** between conductive patterns formed over opposite surfaces, as shown in the Figure 2. This is the structure like the TSVs we are using for 3D IC today.
