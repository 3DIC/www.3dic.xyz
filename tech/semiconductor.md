# Short History of Semiconductor Technology

## Semiconductor Behaviour

Translated into English as "semiconductor," the German word "halbleiter" was first used in 1911 to describe materials with electrical conductivities between those of metals \(conductors\) and insulators.

The first recorded effect that can be ascribed to semiconductor behaviour was the observation by M. Faraday in 1833 that silver sulphide, unlike metals, exhibited a negative temperature coefficient.

In 1928-1931, After Scrodinger, Heisenberg, Bohr, Born, Dirac and Jordan finish inventing quentum theory, people like Bloch, [Alan Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Herries_Wilson) and Rudolf Peierls start applying it to solids, and they come up with `band theory`. They found that, because the phase of the wave function can vary from site to site without violating the boundary condition, bands of allowed energy states exist that may be spread over several eV. They introduced the wave vector k that labels the individual levels in a band and describes the frequency and direction of the phase modulation. And essentially, they showed that a material can be classified as a metal or an insulator according to whether the highest occupied electron level lies within a band or at the bottom of a band gap.

In two short papers titled "The Theory of Electronic Semi-Conductors \(I and II\)" published in 1931, [Alan Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Herries_Wilson) proposed that their peculiar properties were due to the presence of impurity atoms in otherwise pure crystals of these materials.

## Bipolar Transistor

### Point-contact transistor

> The semiconductor point-contact rectifier effect is discovered in 1874. In the first written description of a semiconductor diode, Ferdinand Braun notes that current flows freely in only one direction at the contact between a metal point and a galena crystal.
>
> In 1901, Jagadis Chandra Bose, a professor of physics at Presidency College in Calcutta, India, filed a U.S patent for a point-contact semiconductor rectifier for detecting radio signals.
>
> On August 20, 1906, Greenleaf W. Pickard filed a U.S. patent \(US 836531 A\) on "Means for receiving intelligent communication by electric waves" for a silicon point-contact detector. Just two weeks after Pickard, Henry Dunwoody received a patent for a carborundum \(silicon carbide\) detector.
>
> The first transistor was constructed on 23rd December, 1947 at Bell Laboratories by W.H. Brattain and J. Bardeen and announced to the press on 1st July, 1948, although patent application had beenfiledin February, 1948. It was of a type which later became known as 'point contact' because of its form of construction.
>
> The invention of the point-contact transistor was the indirect result of a failure to produce a successful field effect device.

### Bipolar junction transistor \(BJT\)

> Although the point-contact transistor was the first in the field, the junction transistor possessed far greater potential. This device was invented by W. Shockley working at Bell Laboratories and described in a paper published in July 1949, although Shockley names the date of conception of the device as early as 23rd June 1948 and wrote a detailed theoretical analysis in a patent application filed on 26th June 1948.

## Junction Field-Effect Transistor \(JFET\)

> A succession of FET-like devices were patented by Julius Lilienfeld in the 1920s [^1] and 1930s. However, materials science and fabrication technology would require decades of advances before FETs could actually be made. Following the invention of the bipolar transistor at Bell in 1947, Bell Labs continued work on the FET, with the object of obtaining a device with a higher frequency response than the existing point-contact and grown-junction transistors.
>
> Shockley and Pearson demonstrated the field effect in 1948 and showed that the conductance in the surface region of a semiconductor could be modulated. Following this, in 1953, W.L. Brown postulated the behaviour of an ion-induced conducting channel. In 1955, Ross proposed that such a channel could be made by inducing an inversion layer by means of an electrode placed in the region of the base of a semiconductor device. The difficulty in realising this concept was the lack of a suitable dielectric material across which to induce the charge. This problem was solved by M.M. Atalla in 1959, who proposed that thermally grown silicon dioxide could be used as a gate insulation dielectric, when grown upon single crystal silicon. This was successfully achieved by D. Kahng and M.M. Atalla, of Bell Laboratories, who reported their findings in I960.58 This achievement owed much to the work of Ligenza, who succeeded in growing good quality, high dielectric strength silicon dioxide films by high pressure steam oxidation of silicon. Meanwhile in 1957 J.T.Wallmark of RCA took out a patent on the FET but did no further work in this field. By 1959 P. Weiner, also of RCA had constructed a thin-film FET using cadmium sulphide.
>
> The first commercial field effect transistor was produced in France in 1958 by Stanislaus Teszner, a Polish scientist employed by CFTH, a General Electric affiliate. Called the Technitron, this device was of germanium alloy construc- tion.61 It suffered from the disadvantages of high reverse leakage current and low transconductance, rendering it effectively a low gain amplifying device.

## Planar Transistor Process

The planar transistor process was invented by **Jean A. Hoerni** of the Fairchild Corporation in 1959, and first described in Europe by V.H. Grinich and J.A. Hoerni in February 1961. **This invention opened up the prospect of successful metal-oxide-silicon field-effect transistor \(MOSFET\) and integrated circuit \(IC\) manufacture.**

## Integrated Circuit \(IC\)

On 12 September 1958, Jack S. Kilby demonstrated the first working integrated circuit (consisted of a phase shift oscillator circuit on mesa germanium) to managers at Texas Instruments. This was the first time electronic components were integrated onto a single substrate. Kilby’s reduction to practice of his invention was that of a hybrid IC (using mesa fabrication and isolation techonology instead of planar technology, germanium instead of silicon, and gold wire-bonds interconnects instead of  on-chip interconnects), not a monolithic IC.

In 1959, **R. Noyce** of the Fairchild Corporation, six months after Kilby's success, produced **the first silicon planar IC based on Jean A. Hoerni's planer technology**, thereby rendering the concept commercially viable. **The semiconductor planar process and IC led to the present IC industry**, which today supplies a wide and growing variety of advanced semiconductor products used throughout the world. **R. Noyce **co-founded Fairchild Semiconductor in 1957 and Intel Corporation in 1968.

Table I. Key requirements for making monolithic IC and whether or not they were met by Kilby and Noyce in their respective inventions.

| Key requirements for making IC | Kilby                | Noyce                  |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Monolithic IC                  | Yes                  | Yes                    |
| Planar device fabrication      | No (mesa Ge)         | **Yes (Planar Si)**    |
| Planar device isolation        | No (mesa)            | **Yes (p-n junction)** |
| Planar device interconnections | No (Gold wire bonds) | **Yes (Aluminum)**     |



Kilby won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physics for his part in the invention of the integrated circuit, while R. Noyce died from a heart attach at the age of 62 on June 6th, 1990.

## Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor FET \(MOSFET\) and CMOS FET

In 1930 and 1933 Julius Lilienfeld obtained patents for devices resembling today’s MESFET and MOSFET, respectively.

In 1963 Frank M. Wanlass and C.T. Sah of Fairchild R&D, Palo Alto presented a paper describing the use of complementary MOS \(CMOS\) structures to achieve very low power operation compared to contemporary bipolar circuits at ISSCC in February 1963 [^2].

On 18 June 1963, the first CMOS circuit combining p-channel and n-channel MOS transistors in a complementary symmetry circuit configuration was proposed by Frank Wanlass in a US patent \(US3356858\).
