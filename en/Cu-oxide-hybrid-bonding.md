# Cu/Oxide Hybrid Bonding

## ➶ Problems To Solve

Low-temperature wafer bonding is one of key enabling technologies for the emerging three-dimensional \(3D\) integration of mi- croelectronic/photonic systems. As an evolution of the Cu-Cu and dielectric-dielectric bonding, Cu/dielectric hybrid bonding promises both direct metal interconnections and enhanced thermal/mechanical stability with a seamless bonding structure during the single bonding process. For instance, Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of a hybrid bonding scheme for 3D electrical/optical hybrid interface. This seamless bonding structure mainly consists of Cu-Cu, SiO2-SiO2, and SiO2-SiNx bonding interfaces. The Cu-Cu bonding interface presents a path for electrical and thermal interconnects, while the SiNxcan serve as a Cu diffusion barrier for enhanced reliability and coupler/waveguide \(with SiO2 cladding\) for 3D optical interconnects, respectively. Because of the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients of different materials, bonding at low temperatures of no more than 200 °C is highly desired to reduce the thermal stress and related issues.

Low-temperature Cu-Cu bonding and dielectric-dielectric \(such as SiO2-SiO2\) bonding have been extensively studied because of their potentials for high bonding quality and good compatibility with the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor \(CMOS\) technology. For Cu-Cu bonding, the most widely studied method is the **thermal-compression bonding \(TCB\)**, which is based on Cu interdiffusion across the bonding interface at elevated temperatures. Various prebonding activation methods, such as wet chemical cleaning and heating in a reducing atmosphere \(like [H-containing HCOOH vapor for Cu/adhesive hybrid bonding](/en/Cu-adhesive-hybrid-bonding.md)\), have been developed to reduce the oxides on Cu surfaces for improvement of the Cu interdiffusion at reduced bonding temperatures. But **the TCB method hasn’t shown its benefit for SiO2-SiO2 bonding or SiO2-SiNx bonding**, which is typically based on the hydrophilic bonding mechanism. Several reseaches on Cu/SiO2 hybrid bodning has been done based on the hydrophilic bonding, however, high-temperature postbonding anneal \(300-400 °C\) is still needed to improve the bonding quality. Cu/SiO2 hybrid bonding at low-temperature \(no more than 200 °C\) still remains challenging.

## Research Highlights

1. A combined surface activated bonding method \(with Si-containing Ar beam irradiation and prebonding attach-detach approach\) was proposed,
2. High-quality \(close to bulk strength\) Cu-Cu, SiO2-SiO2, and SiO2-SiNx bonding has been obtained at 200 °C by the same process,
3. Si implantation onto SiO2 surface by [Si-containing Ar beam irradiation](#si-containing-ar-beam) and water management by the [prebodning attach-detach](#prebodning-attach-detach-approach) are considered to contribute to the improvement.

## Combined SAB for Cu/SiO2 and Cu/SiO2/SiNx Hybrid Bonding

### Si-containing Ar beam

Si-containing Ar beam irradiation was used to enable Si-enrichment modification on SiO2 without Si deposition on Cu, thanks to the simultaneous Si subplantation and surface sputtering effects.

### Prebodning Attach-Detach Approach

Prebodning attach-detach refers to to bring two wafers into contact \(aligned\) in air, transport the attached wafer into a vacuum chamber, and detach the wafers before the bonding process in vacuum.
