# Cu/Adhesive Hybrid Bonding at Sub-200 °C for 3D Integration {#tit0005}

Cu/adhesive hybrid bonding is an attractive approach to three-dimensional \(3D\) integration because it provides direct Cu–Cu vertical interconnects and high mechanical stability. However, Cu/adhesive hybrid bonding at below 200 °C is still challenging because of **bonding temperature mismatch** between Cu–Cu and polymer adhesives and lacking of effective adhesive-friendly Cu surface activation methods.

## Research Highlights

* Cu/adhesive hybrid bonding is conducted with pre-bonding treatment in H-containing HCOOH vapor ambient.
* A low-temperature \(sub-200°C\) “Cu-first” hybrid bonding approach is realized.
* The present method enables excellent Cu–Cu bonding with shear strength above 100 MPa at 180–200 °C.
* The surface treatment is friendly to the cyclo-olefin polymer \(COP\) adhesive.
* Seamless Cu/adhesive hybrid bonding has been successfully demonstrated at 180 °C.
* The advantages of the present hybrid process is small thermal stress, higher throughput, and low cost.

## Cu-first Hybrid Bonding approach in H-containing HCOOH vapor ambient

In this work, we investigate and demonstrate a “Cu-first” hybrid bonding technique by using hydrogen\(H\)-containing formic acid \(HCOOH\) vapor prebonding surface treatment as shown in Figure 1. In this technique, high-quality Cu–Cu bonding is obtained at 180–200 °C that is close to or even lower than the temperature of subsequent adhesive curing. We experimentally investigate the effects of the H-containing HCOOH vapor treatment for Cu–Cu bonding and cyclo-olefin polymer adhesive–adhesive bonding. This technique enables Cu/adhesive hybrid bonding at below 200 °C, promising smaller thermal stress, higher throughput, and lower cost comparing to the existing “adhesive-first” hybrid bonding method.
