# Glass-Glass Bonding at 150-200 °C

## ➶ Background

Glass-glass direct and indirect bonding at below 200 °C and even at room temperature.

## Low-temperature Direct Bonding

Plasma activation is used to enable glass-glass direct bonding at room temperature. Great bond strength can be obtained after post-bonding annealing at 150-200 °C.

## Room-temperature Indirect Bonding Using Si Nano-Intermediate Layer

Ar beam irradiation and in situ Si nano-intermediate layer deposition is employed to enable glass-glass indirect bonding at room temperature, resulting bulk-like bond strength.
