# Short History of Transistor and IC

## Bipolar Transistor

### Point-contact transistor

### Bipolar Junction transistor \(BJT\)

## Junction Field-Effect Transistor \(JFET\)

A succession of FET-like devices were patented by Julius Lilienfeld in the 1920s and 1930s. However, materials science and fabrication technology would require decades of advances before FETs could actually be made. The first JFETs were manufactured in 1952. In 1952, alloyed junction transistor was reported \(two pellets of indium were alloyed on the opposite sides of a slice of silicon\).

## Planar transistor

## Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor FET \(MOSFET\) and CMOS FET

In 1930 and 1933 Julius Lilienfeld obtained patents for devices resembling todayâ€™s MESFET and MOSFET, respectively.

In 1963 Steven Hofstein and Fredric Heiman published a paper on a Si MOSFET with a Al gate and SiO2 gate dielectric. In the same year the first CMOS circuit was proposed by Frank Wanlass.
