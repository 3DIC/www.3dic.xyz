# Short History of Transistor and IC

## Bipolar Transistor

### Point-contact transistor

> The first transistor was constructed on 23rd December, 1947 at Bell Laboratories by W.H. Brattain and J. Bardeen and announced to the press on 1stJuly, 1948, although patent application had beenfiledin February, 1948.It was of a type which later became known as 'point contact' because of its form of construction.
>
> The invention of the point-contact transistor was the indirect result of a failure to produce a successful field effect device.

### Bipolar Junction transistor \(BJT\)

> Although the point-contact transistor was the first in the field, the junction transistor possessed far greater potential. This device was invented by W. Shockley working at Bell Laboratories and described in a paper published in July 1949, although Shockley names the date of conception of the device as early as 23rd June 1948 and wrote a detailed theoretical analysis in a patent application filed on 26th June 1948

## Junction Field-Effect Transistor \(JFET\)

A succession of FET-like devices were patented by Julius Lilienfeld in the 1920s and 1930s. However, materials science and fabrication technology would require decades of advances before FETs could actually be made. The first JFETs were manufactured in 1952. In 1952, alloyed junction transistor was reported \(two pellets of indium were alloyed on the opposite sides of a slice of silicon\).

## Planar transistor

The planar transistor process was invented by J.A. Hoerni of the Fairchild Corporation in 1959, and first described in Europe by V.H. Grinich and J.A. Hoerni in February 1961. This invention opened up the prospect of successful integrated circuit manufacture.

## Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor FET \(MOSFET\) and CMOS FET

In 1930 and 1933 Julius Lilienfeld obtained patents for devices resembling todayâ€™s MESFET and MOSFET, respectively.

In 1963 Steven Hofstein and Fredric Heiman published a paper on a Si MOSFET with a Al gate and SiO2 gate dielectric. In the same year the first CMOS circuit was proposed by Frank Wanlass.
