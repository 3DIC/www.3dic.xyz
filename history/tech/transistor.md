# Short History of Transistor and IC

## Bipolar Transistor 

### Point-contact transistor

### Bipolar Junction transistor \(BJT\)

## Field-Effect Transistor \(FET\)

### The first grown junction transistors were manufactured in 1952.

In 1952 alloyed junction transistor was re- ported \(two pellets of indium were alloyed on the opposite sides of a slice of silicon\).

## Planar transistor

## Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor FET \(MOSFET\) and CMOS transistors

In 1930 and 1933 Julius Lilienfeld obtained patents for de- vices resembling todayâ€™s MESFET and MOSFET, respectively.

In 1963 Steven Hofstein and Fredric Heiman published a paper on a silicon MOSFET with a Al gate and SiO2 gate dielectric. In the same year the first CMOS circuit was proposed by Frank Wanlass.

## Integrated Circuit \(IC\)

## Poly-Si gate MOSFET

## High-k/metal-gate MOSFET

## Multi-gate MOSFET

## SOI MOSFET
