# Short History of Transistors

Point-contact transistor

## Field-Effect Bipolar Transistor

## Junction transistor

The first grown junction transistors were manufactured in 1952.

In 1952 alloyed junction transistor was re- ported \(two pellets of indium were alloyed on the opposite sides of a slice of silicon\).

## Planar transistor

## Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor \(MOSFET\) and CMOS transistors

## Integrated Circuit \(IC\)
