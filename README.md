## About Me

Hello! I am Ran He. This is my personal website.

I am currently a Project Researcher in Prof. T. Suga's group at the University of Tokyo, with great interests in low-temperature bonding \(especially surface activated bonding methods and bump-less [Cu/adhesive](/en/Cu-adhesive-hybrid-bonding.md) and [Cu/oxide](/en/Cu-oxide-hybrid-bonding.md) hybrid bonding techniques\),  semiconductor advanced packaging, 3D interconnects, and 3D IC technology.
