## About

Hello! I am Ran He. This is my personal website.

I am currently a Project Researcher in Prof. T. Suga's group at the University of Tokyo, with great interests in low-temperature bonding \(especially surface activated bonding methods and bump-less [Cu/adhesive](/en/Cu-adhesive-hybrid-bonding.md) and [Cu/oxide](/en/Cu-oxide-hybrid-bonding.md) hybrid bonding techniques\),  semiconductor advanced packaging, 3D interconnects, and 3D IC technology.

You can find more about me on the following links:

## My Research

### Low-temperature Bonding

* [Cu/Adhesive Hybrid Bonding at sub-200 °C](/en/Cu-adhesive-hybrid-bonding.md) in [H-containing HCOOH vapor](/sab/h-containing-hcooh-vapor.md) ambient

* [Cu/Oxide Hybrid Bonding](en/Cu-oxide-hybrid-bonding.md) by [Combined SAB](/sab/combined-sab.md) at sub-200 °C

* [Cu-Cu and Au-Cu Direct Die Attach](/en/direct-die-attach.md) for high-power device packaging by in [H-containing HCOOH vapor](/sab/h-containing-hcooh-vapor.md) treatment
